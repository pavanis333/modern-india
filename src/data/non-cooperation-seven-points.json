        "answer": "Seven-Point Non-Cooperation Program Structure: Point 1 - Symbolic Rejection: Relinquishing titles and honorary offices. Rejecting British honors/recognition. Significance: Public renunciation delegitimizing British authority. Included: Observance of strict non-violence (Gandhian principle differentiating from revolutionary terrorism). Establishment of Panchayats for settling disputes (UPSC 2025): Creating alternative indigenous institutions replacing British courts. This combined symbolic rejection with constructive alternative. Point 2 - Social/Ceremonial Boycott: Abstaining from Government durbars and official functions. Refusing social interaction with colonial administration. Breaking elite collaboration with British ceremonial/social events. Point 3 - Educational Boycott (UPSC 2025): Boycotting Government or Government aided educational Institutions. Rejecting colonial education system. Led to establishment of national schools/colleges (constructive program parallel). Point 4 - Legal System Rejection: Avoiding British courts. Refusing colonial justice system. Combined with Panchayats (Point 1) creating alternative dispute resolution. Point 5 - Military/Service Resistance: Resisting all classes' participation in Mesopotamia service. Context: WWI (1914-18), Britain using Indian soldiers/resources. Non-cooperation included refusing military service for imperial wars. Point 6 - Legislative Non-Cooperation: Refraining from provincial and central assembly elections. Rejecting limited self-government (Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms 1919). Refusing participation in colonial legislative structures. Point 7 - Economic Resistance: Boycotting foreign goods. Swadeshi movement economic dimension. Promoting indigenous production/consumption. Comprehensive Strategy: Symbolic (Point 1): Public delegitimization + alternative institutions (Panchayats). Social (Point 2): Breaking elite collaboration. Institutional (Points 3-4): Educational and legal boycott. Political (Points 5-6): Military service and electoral refusal. Economic (Point 7): Foreign goods boycott, Swadeshi promotion. This touched every aspect of colonial rule: honors, social interaction, education, justice, military, politics, economy. Made colonial administration unworkable without Indian cooperation. Gandhian Innovation: Strict non-violence (Point 1) differentiating from revolutionary violence. Constructive alternatives: Panchayats (Point 1), national schools (Point 3 implied), Swadeshi (Point 7). Mass participation: All seven points accessible to different classes - elites (titles), students (education), lawyers (courts), voters (elections), consumers (foreign goods). Program's completeness made it comprehensive challenge to British rule across all dimensions simultaneously."

        "question": "Examine Points 1 and 3 (UPSC 2025 tagged) in detail, analyzing their significance in the Non-Cooperation program and their emphasis on alternative institution-building.",
        "answer": "Point 1 (UPSC 2025) - Multi-Dimensional: Components: 1) Relinquishing titles and honorary offices, 2) Observance of strict non-violence, 3) Establishment of Panchayats for settling disputes. Relinquishing Titles: Indians who received British honors (titles like Rai Bahadur, Khan Bahadur, knighthoods, etc.) publicly returning them. Significance: Delegitimizing British authority by rejecting its symbols of recognition. Public spectacle: Title renunciation ceremonies demonstrating rejection of colonial patronage. Elite participation: Upper/middle-class Indians showing solidarity with mass movement. Strict Non-Violence: Gandhian core principle. Differentiating Non-Cooperation from revolutionary terrorism (1907-17 phase). Moral high ground: Non-violent resistance vs British violence. Mass mobilization: Non-violence enabling wider participation (women, elderly, all classes). Discipline: Strict observance preventing British justification for repression. Establishment of Panchayats: Alternative institution-building (constructive program). Replacing British courts for dispute settlement. Indigenous self-governance: Reviving traditional Indian conflict resolution. Practical: Providing justice mechanism while boycotting colonial courts (Point 4). Legal alternative: Panchayats making court boycott viable. Significance: Point 1 wasn't just negative (rejecting titles) but positive (creating alternatives - Panchayats), included movement's ethical foundation (non-violence), combined elite (title holders) and mass (Panchayat users) participation. Point 3 (UPSC 2025) - Educational Boycott: Boycotting Government or Government aided educational Institutions. Targeting colonial education system: Schools, colleges, universities producing English-educated elite serving British administration. Significance: Breaking colonial knowledge production. Elite participation: Students leaving government schools/colleges. Mass impact: Educational institutions emptying challenged British institutional legitimacy. Constructive Alternative (Implied): National schools/colleges established (Gujarat Vidyapith, Jamia Millia Islamia, Kashi Vidyapeeth, Bihar Vidyapeeth). Indigenous curriculum: Replacing colonial education with nationalist/indigenous knowledge. Long-term: Creating alternative educated class loyal to nationalist movement, not British. Practical Challenges: Students sacrificing career prospects (government jobs required British degrees). Financial: National schools needed funding without government aid. Sustainability: Many students returned to government institutions when movement suspended (1922). But legacy: National educational institutions survived, becoming centers of nationalist thought. Why UPSC 2025 Tagged These Two: Point 1: Comprehensive (titles + non-violence + Panchayats), combining negative (rejection) with positive (alternatives), fundamental to Gandhian philosophy (non-violence). Point 3: Significant impact (educational system), constructive alternative (national schools), elite mobilization (students). Both demonstrated Non-Cooperation's dual strategy: Boycott British institutions + Build indigenous alternatives. This constructive dimension distinguished Gandhian Non-Cooperation from purely negative resistance. Panchayats (Point 1) and National Schools (Point 3) were foundations for parallel governance structure, attempting to make British rule irrelevant by creating functioning indigenous alternatives."

        "question": "Compare the political non-cooperation elements (Points 5-6: Mesopotamia service and election boycott) with economic resistance (Point 7: foreign goods boycott), analyzing their strategic objectives and effectiveness.",
        "answer": "Political Non-Cooperation: Point 5 - Mesopotamia Service Resistance: Context: WWI (1914-18) ending but resentment over Indian sacrifice for imperial war. British recruited Indian soldiers and resources for Middle Eastern campaigns (Mesopotamia - modern Iraq). Resistance: 'All classes' participation' - not just soldiers but laborers, resources, funds for war effort. Objective: Refusing to support British imperial wars. Signaling: Indian resources for India, not British empire. Anti-imperialist: Connecting Indian freedom with opposition to British imperialism globally. Effectiveness: Limited direct impact (WWI already ended by Non-Cooperation 1920-22) but established principle: India won't fight Britain's wars. Legacy: Later conscription resistance, INA (Indian National Army) collaboration with Axis powers WWII. Point 6 - Election Boycott: Context: Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (1919) creating provincial/central legislatures with limited Indian participation (dyarchy). Boycott: Refraining from participating in provincial and central assembly elections. Objective: Rejecting 'crumbs' of limited self-government. Signaling: Complete independence demand, not moderate constitutional reforms. Delegitimizing: Low turnout in elections showing Indian rejection of British constitutional framework. Effectiveness: Mixed: 1920-22 elections low turnout, but later Congress participated (1923 onwards - Swarajists entering councils). Tactical: Demonstrated Congress could mobilize electoral boycott, but also revealed electoral politics' attraction. Point 5 vs Point 6: Military/Resource resistance (Point 5) vs Legislative resistance (Point 6). Both rejecting different aspects of British empire (imperial wars vs constitutional collaboration). Point 5 more symbolic (WWI ending), Point 6 more ongoing (elections every few years). Economic Resistance: Point 7 - Foreign Goods Boycott: Swadeshi dimension: Boycotting British cloth, goods. Promoting indigenous production (khadi, handloom). Objective: Economic self-reliance. Hitting British economic interests (Manchester cotton exports to India). Visible resistance: Bonfires of foreign cloth, spinning khadi, wearing homespun. Effectiveness: Significant: British textile exports to India dropped. Mass participation: Every Indian could participate (unlike title holders, students, voters). Symbolic: Khadi becoming nationalist uniform (Gandhi, Congress leaders wearing). Economic foundation: Building indigenous industry (though limited success initially). Sustainability: Continued beyond 1922 (even after Non-Cooperation suspended, Swadeshi remained). Comparison - Political vs Economic: Scope: Political (Points 5-6) targeted specific groups (soldiers/laborers, voters). Economic (Point 7) universal (all consumers). Visibility: Foreign goods boycott highly visible (cloth burning, khadi wearing). Electoral boycott less visible (absence from voting). British interests: Economic boycott directly hurt British trade. Political boycott embarrassing but less economically damaging. Participation: Point 7 enabled mass participation across all classes. Points 5-6 more limited (soldiers, voters). Constructive alternative: Point 7 had clear alternative (khadi, Swadeshi). Points 5-6 less clear (what replaces military service? elections?). Sustainability: Point 7 continued long-term (Swadeshi became permanent nationalist plank). Point 6 abandoned (Congress entered elections 1923). Point 5 became irrelevant (no major war 1920-39). Strategic Effectiveness: Point 7 (Economic) Most Effective: Direct economic impact on British. Mass participation enabling sustained movement. Clear alternative (khadi/Swadeshi). Visible symbol unifying movement. Continued beyond 1922 suspension. Point 6 (Election Boycott) Tactically Effective: Demonstrated Congress electoral mobilization capacity. Rejected limited reforms, maintaining pressure for fuller independence. But abandoned when tactical (Swarajists argued entering councils more effective). Point 5 (War Resistance) Symbolically Important: Established anti-imperialist principle. But limited immediate impact (WWI over, no major war soon). Overall: Economic resistance (Point 7) proved most durable and effective dimension of Non-Cooperation, while political dimensions (Points 5-6) were more tactical/temporary. This showed economic foundations (Swadeshi) more sustainable than political boycotts, influencing later nationalist strategy emphasizing economic self-reliance alongside political independence."
