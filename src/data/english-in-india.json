Key Privileges: Exemption from additional customs duties in Bengal (annual payment of Rs 3,000). Authority to issue passes (dastaks) for goods transport and lease more lands around Calcutta. Exemption from duties in Hyderabad. Duty exemption in Surat for Rs 10,000. Coins minted in Bombay were recognized throughout the Mughal Empire. Significance: These farmans significantly reduced Company's operational costs through customs exemptions, expanded territorial foothold through land leasing rights, facilitated trade through dastak authority, and provided economic legitimacy through coin recognition. The farmans represented peak of Mughal concessions to Company, enabling extensive commercial operations across multiple regions while paying relatively modest annual sums."

This period showed Company's evolution from trading entity to quasi-sovereign power (military, diplomatic, minting authorities), financial vulnerabilities creating competition, and ultimate consolidation through merger ensuring monopolistic dominance until 1873."
