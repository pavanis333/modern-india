        "question": "Trace the decline of Bengal's autonomy from Murshid Quli Khan (1700-1727) through the succession to Siraj-ud-Daulah (1756), analyzing the growing British influence and internal instability.",
        "answer": "Murshid Quli Khan (1700-1727): Established foundations for British trade in Bengal. Earlier we learned he became independent Nawab after 1717, shifting capital to Murshidabad, introducing Mal Jasmani revenue reform. Now we see he also enabled British commercial presence. Context: Bengal was wealthy Mughal province exporting saltpetre, rice, indigo, textiles to Europe. Since 1630s, EIC sourced around 60% of Asian imports from Bengal - massive dependence. Succession: Murshid Quli Khan \u2192 Shujauddin \u2192 Sarfaraz Khan \u2192 Alivardi Khan (ruled until 1756). Alivardi Khan: Stopped tribute to Mughal Emperor - asserting autonomy. Defeated Marathas, allowed British to fortify Fort William. However, grew wary of increasing European influence. Contradiction: Permitted fortification but concerned about influence. Economic/Political Context: Bengal remained stable while other regions faced invasions. Calcutta population: 15,000 (1706) to ~100,000 (1750) - dramatic growth showing British commercial expansion. Tensions: Growing dissatisfaction among Bengali rulers over financial benefits to British. British presence enriching themselves while Nawab's finances strained. Siraj-ud-Daulah (1756): Inherited politically unstable Bengal. Internal Challenges: Faced dissent from commanders like Shaukat Jang and Mir Jafar. Dominant court group (Jagat Seth, Omnichand) opposed Siraj. Actions like executing rivals alienated factions, especially as British power grew. External Challenge: Resented British fortification of Fort William, saw it as threat. Pattern: Murshid Quli Khan enabled British trade (1700-1727) \u2192 Succession maintaining Bengal autonomy \u2192 Alivardi Khan's contradictory policy (allowing fortification but wary of influence) \u2192 Siraj inheriting unstable Bengal with powerful British presence and internal opposition (1756). Result: By 1756, Bengal faced external threat (British military buildup) and internal weakness (court factionalism), setting stage for British conquest. British had spent 130+ years (1630s-1756) building economic dominance (60% of Asian imports), now converting commercial to political/military power."

        "question": "Analyze the Battle of Plassey (1757) in detail: prelude (internal rivalries, economic tensions, Black Hole Tragedy, Siraj's response), Clive's strategy, outcome, and immediate aftermath including Mir Jafar's ascension and subsequent tensions.",
        "answer": "Prelude - Internal Rivalries: Siraj's court rife with factionalism involving key figures Mir Jafar and Jagat Seth. These would become British collaborators. Court divided, Siraj lacked unified support. Economic Tensions: British misused trade privileges, damaging Nawab's finances. Specific grievance building on broader dissatisfaction over financial benefits to British. Black Hole Tragedy: British captives allegedly killed, escalating tensions. Controversial incident (historiography debates authenticity) but used to justify British response. Siraj's Response: Concerned about British military buildup (fortification of Fort William). Captured Calcutta in June 1756, renamed it Alinagar. Attempting to assert authority, curb British military presence. Clive's Strategy: Forged alliances with Siraj's internal rivals. Key: Exploited court factionalism, made deals with Mir Jafar, Jagat Seth, others. Military victory achieved through political subversion more than battlefield superiority. Battle (June 23, 1757): British forces outnumbered but won decisively. Mir Jafar and co-conspirators didn't fight effectively for Siraj. Outcome: Siraj executed, British control began in Bengal. Turning point: Commercial company becoming territorial power. Mir Jafar's Ascension: In exchange for support, Mir Jafar became new Nawab. Puppet ruler: Cementing British dominance over Bengal. British gained: 1) Political control (Nawab dependent on them), 2) Military victory legitimacy, 3) Access to Bengal revenues. Subsequent Tensions: Mir Jafar grew frustrated with British interference. Despite being installed by British, chafed under their control. Shows British dominance intrusive even over collaborator. Battle of Biderra (1759): Mir Jafar involved, ended in British victory. Even puppet Nawab couldn't resist effectively. Treaty of 1760: Mir Jafar's son-in-law Mir Qasim installed as new ally. British discarding Mir Jafar when he proved insufficiently compliant, replacing with next generation. Further increasing British control. Pattern: Internal conspiracy (Clive's alliances) \u2192 Military victory despite being outnumbered (Plassey June 23, 1757) \u2192 Puppet Nawab (Mir Jafar) \u2192 Continued British interference \u2192 Replacement when necessary (Mir Qasim 1760). Plassey decisive not just militarily but politically: Converted British from traders to rulers, established pattern of using internal divisions, showed Indian rulers (even collaborators) had no real autonomy under British dominance."

        "question": "Examine Mir Qasim's attempts at reform and resistance (capital shift, military modernization), the Battle of Buxar (1764), and its consequences including Shah Alam II's agreements and the establishment of Dual Government (1765-1772).",
        "answer": "Mir Qasim's Reforms: Capital Shift: Moved capital from Murshidabad to Munger to reduce British influence. Strategic: Murshidabad too close to British Calcutta/Fort William. Munger more interior, attempting geographic distance from British interference. Military Modernization: Initiated European-style military reforms and sought territorial expansion. Learning from defeats: Adopting European tactics/organization to resist British. Territorial ambitions: Not just defensive but attempting to build independent power base. Challenges: Faced challenges from internal forces and British interference, leading to political instability. Shows even reform-minded ruler couldn't escape British pressure or internal opposition. Battle of Buxar (1764): Mir Qasim's Resistance: Challenged British dominance by misusing Dastaks (trade permits) - economic resistance. Formed alliance with Shah Alam II (Mughal Emperor) and Shuja-ud-Daula (Nawab of Awadh). Grand alliance: Bengal + Mughal Emperor + Awadh vs British. Most significant Indian alliance against British. Outcome: British forces led by Major Hector Munro defeated combined forces. Despite numerical/political superiority (Emperor + two Nawabs), British won. More decisive than Plassey: Defeated not just regional ruler but coalition including Emperor. Shah Alam II's Agreements (Post-Buxar): 1) Reside at Allahabad, to be ceded by Nawab of Awadh, under Company protection. Emperor becomes British dependent, living on Company-controlled territory. 2) Issue Farman granting Diwani of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa to EIC for Rs 26 lakh annual payment. Revenue rights: British now legally (via Emperor's Farman) collect revenues. 3) Rs 53 lakh to Company for Nizamat functions (military defence, police, administration of justice). Law enforcement: British controlling security/justice functions. Total: Rs 79 lakh payments but British gaining revenue collection (far more valuable). Dual Government (1765-1772): Structure: EIC took over revenue rights (Diwani) and law enforcement (Nizamat), while Nawab retained only ceremonial authority. Nominal Indian rule, real British power. Failure: Failed to maintain order or manage Bengal's economy. Dual authority = no clear responsibility. Company interested in revenue extraction, Nawab powerless to govern, neither maintaining infrastructure/administration. Abolishment: Warren Hastings abolished Dual Government in 1772. British taking direct control, ending even pretense of Indian authority. Significance: Buxar (1764) more important than Plassey (1757): Defeated grand alliance including Mughal Emperor, gained legal cover (Emperor's Farman) for territorial control, established British as paramount power in northern India. Dual Government transition: From puppet Nawab (post-Plassey) to shared authority (1765-1772) to direct British rule (post-1772). Bengal conquest pattern: Commercial dominance (pre-1757) \u2192 Military victory (Plassey 1757) \u2192 Puppet rule (1757-1765) \u2192 Dual control (1765-1772) \u2192 Direct rule (1772+). British gradually dropping pretense of Indian sovereignty as they consolidated power."
