The Portuguese stayed for 463 years and the French for 290 years, both significantly longer than trading-focused Dutch (223 years) and Danish (229 years).

        "answer": "The shift from Calcutta to Delhi under Crown Rule (1858-1947) marked the transition from trade-focused colonial rule to direct imperial governance after the 1857 Revolt. Delhi, as the historic Mughal capital, provided symbolic legitimacy and central strategic control over the entire subcontinent. This move represented Britain's transformation from a trading company to a sovereign imperial power, claiming succession to Mughal authority."

The English established 7 centers spread across all coasts (Masulipatnam-east, Surat-west, Madras-east, Hugli-east, Bombay-west, Calcutta-east) between 1611-1690. This reveals the Portuguese pursued a concentrated western coastal strategy for Arabian Sea trade control, while the English pursued a diversified pan-India strategy securing access to multiple regions and hinterlands, enabling greater territorial expansion."

        "question": "Analyze why the French established their first factory at Surat (1668) rather than Pondicherry, which became their eventual headquarters.",
        "answer": "Surat was India's premier port and commercial hub in the 17th century, already hosting English (1612) and Dutch (1616) factories. The French chose Surat for immediate market access and to compete directly with rival European powers. Pondicherry (1674) was developed later as a strategic alternative on the southeastern coast, offering: 1) Distance from intense Anglo-Dutch competition, 2) Access to the Coromandel Coast and Bay of Bengal trade, 3) Better defensive positioning. This two-phase strategy balanced immediate commercial entry with long-term territorial ambitions."

        "question": "The Danish established only two trading centers (Tranquebar 1620, Serampore 1755) compared to other European powers. What factors might explain their limited footprint?",
        "answer": "Denmark's limited presence (just 2 centers over 135 years) reflected: 1) Smaller national economy and resources compared to England, France, or Netherlands, 2) Late entry (1616) into an already competitive market, 3) Focus on niche trades rather than territorial expansion, 4) Lack of naval power to defend extensive networks, 5) Geographic focus on specific regions (Tranquebar near Tamil coast, Serampore near Calcutta). Eventually, commercial viability issues led them to sell to the British in 1845, confirming their trading-only rather than colonial approach."

      {
        "id": "comp009",
        "question": "Examine the clustering of European factories in certain regions like Surat. What made these locations attractive to multiple European powers?",
        "answer": "Surat attracted Portuguese, Dutch (1616), English (1612), and French (1668) because it was: 1) The Mughal Empire's primary western port with established trade infrastructure, 2) Gateway to rich hinterlands of Gujarat and access to inland markets, 3) Hub for textile exports (cotton, silk) highly desired in Europe, 4) Strategic location for Arabian Sea and Red Sea trade routes, 5) Relatively stable political environment under Mughal authority. Multiple European presence created competitive but also parasitic relationships - they could share infrastructure, intelligence, and protection while competing for trade share."

        "id": "comp010",
        "question": "How did the establishment of Crown Rule in 1858 fundamentally change the nature of British presence in India compared to the earlier East India Company period?",
        "answer": "Crown Rule (1858-1947) transformed British presence from commercial to sovereign: 1) Direct governance by British monarch/Parliament replaced Company profit-driven administration, 2) Shift in goals from trade maximization to territorial control and strategic imperial interests, 3) Headquarters move from Calcutta to Delhi symbolized claiming Mughal succession, 4) Introduction of 'civilizing mission' ideology versus pure mercantilism, 5) Formal integration into British Empire with India as 'Crown Jewel', 6) Establishment of Indian Civil Service and modern administrative apparatus. This marked evolution from merchant-colonialism to full imperial control."
