        "question": "Analyze the three-category structure of Gandhi's Eleven Demands: Issue of General Interest (6), Specific Bourgeois Demands (3), and Specific Peasant Demands (2), examining how this reflected Gandhi's strategy of building a broad anti-colonial coalition.",
        "answer": "Three-Category Structure: Issue of General Interest (6 demands): 1) 50% reduction in Army/civil services expenditure, 2) Enforce total prohibition, 3) CID reforms, 4) Arms Act amendment (popular control over firearms licenses), 5) Release political prisoners, 6) Approve Postal Reservation Bill. Scope: Broadest category (6/11 demands). Mix of: Economic (expenditure reduction), Social (prohibition), Political (CID reforms, political prisoners, Arms Act), Administrative (Postal Reservation). Appeal: Universal issues affecting all Indians, not class-specific. Specific Bourgeois Demands (3 demands): 7) Decrease rupee-sterling exchange ratio to 1s 4d, 8) Introduce textile protection, 9) Reserve coastal shipping for Indians. Focus: Economic interests of Indian businessmen/industrialists. Exchange rate: Currency strength affecting trade/commerce. Textile protection: Protecting domestic industry from British imports. Coastal shipping: Indian merchant marine vs British shipping lines. Class: Urban industrial/commercial bourgeoisie. Specific Peasant Demands (2 demands): 10) Slash land revenue by 50%, 11) Abolish salt tax and government's salt monopoly. Focus: Rural/agrarian grievances. Land revenue: Colonial taxation burden on cultivators. Salt: Essential commodity monopolized/taxed by government. Class: Peasantry/rural masses. Coalition-Building Strategy: Numerical distribution: General (6) + Bourgeois (3) + Peasant (2) = 11. Majority general issues (6/11) preventing perception as class-specific. Class alliance: Including both bourgeois (urban/industrial) and peasant (rural/agrarian) specific demands. Recognizing: Anti-colonial movement needed alliance of all classes. Different classes had different grievances requiring specific demands. Broad appeal: General issues (political prisoners, prohibition, CID reforms) uniting all. Specific demands: Addressing particular class grievances without alienating others. Economic transformation: Demands touching currency (exchange rate), trade (textile, shipping), agriculture (land revenue, salt). Not just political independence but economic restructuring. Symbol (Salt): Demand 11 (peasant) becoming movement symbol (Salt March 1930). Salt: Universal necessity (not just peasant issue) making peasant demand resonate nationally. Strategic: Brilliant choice linking specific (peasant) with universal (everyone uses salt). Coalition success: Eleven Demands bringing together: Urban educated (political prisoners, CID reforms), Business class (exchange rate, textile, shipping), Peasantry (land revenue, salt), General public (prohibition, expenditure reduction, Arms Act). This breadth made Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34) more comprehensive than earlier movements. Limitations: Only 2/11 peasant demands (despite peasants being majority). Bourgeois getting 3/11 despite being smaller class. Reflecting: Gandhi's middle-class Congress leadership, Need to secure funding/support from business class, Difficulty fully mobilizing peasantry (land revenue 50% reduction modest, not abolition). Nevertheless: Structure demonstrated sophisticated understanding that successful nationalism required multi-class coalition, with specific demands for each constituency while maintaining overarching general/political framework (6 general demands)."

        "question": "Examine the economic demands across all three categories, analyzing how they challenged British colonial economic exploitation through currency (rupee-sterling), trade (textile protection, coastal shipping), taxation (land revenue, salt), and expenditure (Army/civil services).",
        "answer": "Economic Demands Distribution: General Interest: Demand 1 - 50% reduction in Army/civil services expenditure. Bourgeois: Demands 7-9 - Exchange rate, textile protection, coastal shipping. Peasant: Demands 10-11 - Land revenue reduction, salt tax abolition. Total: 6/11 demands explicitly economic (1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). Currency - Exchange Rate (Demand 7 Bourgeois): Decrease rupee-sterling exchange ratio to 1s 4d. Context: British controlling Indian currency policy, exchange rate affecting trade competitiveness. Indian businessmen: Lower rupee value making Indian exports cheaper, imports expensive. Colonial exploitation: Exchange rate favoring British imports, disadvantaging Indian industry. Significance: Challenging colonial monetary policy, demanding Indian economic interests prioritized. Trade Protection - Textile (Demand 8 Bourgeois): Introduce textile protection. Context: British textile imports (Manchester cotton) flooding Indian market, destroying indigenous textile industry. Protection: Tariffs/restrictions on British textiles. Swadeshi connection: Economic nationalism (boycott foreign cloth) becoming policy demand. Colonial drain: British exports to India vs Indian handicrafts decline. Trade Protection - Shipping (Demand 9 Bourgeois): Reserve coastal shipping for Indians. Context: British shipping lines dominating Indian coastal trade. Reservation: Indian merchant marine priority. Economic sovereignty: Controlling own maritime trade, not dependent on British ships. Significance: Both textile and shipping (Demands 8-9) challenging British commercial monopoly. Agricultural Taxation - Land Revenue (Demand 10 Peasant): Slash land revenue by 50%. Context: Colonial land revenue system extracting heavy taxes from cultivators. Burden: Fixed/increased revenue regardless of harvest, impoverishing peasants. 50% reduction: Significant relief but not abolition (conservative demand). Colonial exploitation: Land revenue major colonial revenue source, draining rural India. Consumer Taxation - Salt (Demand 11 Peasant): Abolish salt tax and government's salt monopoly. Context: Salt essential commodity, government monopoly making it expensive, taxed. Impact: Universal necessity, tax affecting poorest most. Monopoly: Government controlling production/sale, preventing free market. Symbolic: Salt tax epitomizing colonial exploitation of basic needs. Colonial Expenditure (Demand 1 General): 50% reduction in Army and civil services expenditure. Context: Indian revenues funding British Army in India and bloated civil services (British officials). Drain: India paying for own colonization (Army suppressing Indians, officials administering colony). Economic burden: Reducing expenditure freeing resources for Indian development. Significance: Challenging colonial administrative costs borne by India. Comprehensive Economic Challenge: Currency control (Demand 7): Monetary sovereignty. Trade policy (Demands 8-9): Industrial/commercial protection. Agricultural taxation (Demand 10): Rural tax relief. Consumer taxation (Demand 11): Essential commodity access. Colonial expenditure (Demand 1): Reducing exploitation costs. Pattern: Every major aspect of colonial economic exploitation targeted: Currency (exchange rate favoring Britain), Trade (British imports destroying Indian industry), Agriculture (heavy land revenue), Consumption (salt tax/monopoly), Administration (Indian revenues funding British). Colonial Economic System: British controlling: Currency policy (rupee-sterling rate), Trade policy (tariffs favoring British exports), Tax policy (land revenue, salt tax extracting wealth), Administrative expenditure (Army, civil services costly for India). Eleven Demands challenging all four dimensions. Economic Nationalism: Demands 1, 7-11 (6/11) showing economic independence inseparable from political. Not just 'British leave' but 'British economic system dismantled'. Linking: Political demands (political prisoners, CID reforms, Arms Act) with economic demands (exchange rate, taxation, expenditure). Movement understanding: Independence meaningless without economic transformation. Salt March Connection: Demand 11 (salt) becoming Civil Disobedience Movement symbol (1930 Salt March). Gandhi's genius: Choosing economic demand (salt tax/monopoly) that: Was universal (everyone needs salt), Symbolized colonial exploitation (taxing necessity), Could be directly challenged (making salt = breaking monopoly), Linked peasant specific demand (salt tax) with national issue (everyone affected). Economic demands (especially salt) making Civil Disobedience economically radical despite Gandhi's political moderation, challenging fundamental colonial economic structures: taxation, monopoly, trade policy, currency control, administrative costs."

        "question": "Compare the 'Issue of General Interest' (6 demands) with the specific class demands (Bourgeois 3, Peasant 2), analyzing which category most challenged colonial power structures and why Gandhi might have emphasized general over specific demands numerically.",
        "answer": "Issue of General Interest (6 demands): 1) 50% reduction in Army/civil services expenditure. 2) Enforce total prohibition. 3) CID reforms. 4) Arms Act amendment (popular control over firearms licenses). 5) Release political prisoners. 6) Approve Postal Reservation Bill. Analysis: Economic: Demand 1 (expenditure reduction). Social: Demand 2 (prohibition). Political/Security: Demands 3-5 (CID, Arms Act, political prisoners). Administrative: Demand 6 (Postal Reservation). Mix: Not focused on one area but diverse issues affecting all Indians. Challenge to Colonial Power: Demand 1 (Expenditure): Challenging colonial fiscal policy - India funding its own colonization. Demand 3 (CID): Challenging colonial surveillance/repression apparatus. Demand 4 (Arms Act): Challenging colonial monopoly on firearms - enabling armed resistance potential. Demand 5 (Political prisoners): Challenging colonial right to imprison nationalists. Significance: Four of six (1, 3, 4, 5) directly challenging colonial coercive/administrative power. Specific Bourgeois Demands (3): 7) Exchange rate, 8) Textile protection, 9) Coastal shipping. Analysis: All economic, benefiting Indian businessmen/industrialists. Challenge: Colonial economic exploitation but not political/administrative structures directly. Limited: Class-specific benefits, not universal. Specific Peasant Demands (2): 10) Land revenue 50% reduction, 11) Salt tax/monopoly abolition. Analysis: Both taxation (land revenue, salt). Challenge: Colonial revenue extraction but economic grievances. Limited: Rural focus, though salt broader (universal necessity). Comparison - Challenge Level: Political/Administrative Challenge: General Interest (4/6 demands): Army expenditure, CID, Arms Act, political prisoners. Directly threaten colonial governance structures. Bourgeois (0/3): No direct political challenge, only economic demands. Peasant (0/2): No direct political challenge, only tax grievances. Winner: General Interest most politically radical. Economic Challenge: General Interest (1/6): Expenditure reduction. Bourgeois (3/3): Exchange rate, textile, shipping - comprehensive economic demands. Peasant (2/2): Land revenue, salt - taxation demands. Winner: Bourgeois most economically comprehensive (3/3 economic). Overall: General Interest most threatening to colonial power because it challenged: Fiscal policy (expenditure), Security apparatus (CID, Arms Act), Political legitimacy (political prisoners). Why Gandhi Emphasized General (6/11): Strategic Reasoning: 1) Broader Appeal: General demands unite all classes, not divisive. Prohibition, political prisoners, CID reforms appeal universally. Specific demands (exchange rate, land revenue) limited to particular classes. 2) Political Focus: General demands (4/6) challenging colonial governance directly. Keeping movement politically focused, not just economic grievance articulation. Revolutionary potential: Arms Act amendment enabling armed resistance. 3) Avoiding Class Conflict: 6 general + 3 bourgeois + 2 peasant = preventing perception as peasant/class movement. More general demands = broader nationalist movement, less class struggle. 4) Middle-Class Leadership: Congress dominated by urban educated middle class. General demands (CID, political prisoners, Arms Act) affecting this class directly. 5) Symbolic Balance: 6 general preventing any one class (bourgeois or peasant) dominating. Though bourgeois got 3 and peasants only 2, general majority (6) balanced this. Limitations of Numerical Emphasis: Peasant Under-Representation: Only 2/11 demands despite peasants being demographic majority. Land revenue 50% reduction moderate (not abolition), salt tax abolition radical but only 2 total. Reflecting: Gandhi's difficulty fully mobilizing peasantry, Congress leadership's urban/middle-class character, Fear of radical peasant demands (land redistribution, revenue abolition) alienating landlords/bourgeoisie. Bourgeois Over-Representation: 3/11 despite being small class. Economic demands (exchange rate, textile, shipping) benefiting businessmen disproportionately. Reflecting: Congress needing business funding/support, Bourgeoisie's importance in economic nationalism (Swadeshi, indigenous industry). Nevertheless: Six general demands preventing movement appearing bourgeois-dominated. Most Radical Demand: Arguably Demand 4 (Arms Act amendment) - enabling popular armed resistance. Hidden radical potential: If Indians controlled firearms, British coercive apparatus challenged fundamentally. Demand 11 (salt) becoming most famous: Universal necessity making peasant demand nationally resonant. Salt March (1930) making economic/peasant demand political symbol. Conclusion: Gandhi's numerical emphasis on general interest (6/11) was strategic masterstroke: United diverse classes under common nationalist demands, Challenged colonial governance directly (CID, Arms Act, political prisoners), Prevented perception as class movement (avoiding bourgeois or peasant domination), Maintained broad coalition essential for mass movement. However, under-representation of peasant demands (2/11) despite demographic majority showed limitations of Congress' middle-class leadership and Gandhi's conservative social reformism versus radical economic transformation."
