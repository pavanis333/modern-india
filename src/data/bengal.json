        "question": "Trace the establishment and succession of independent Bengal from Murshid Quli Khan (post-1717) through to the Battle of Plassey (1757).",
        "answer": "Founder: Murshid Quli Khan, former Diwan under Aurangzeb, became independent Nawab after 1717. Background as Diwan gave him financial and administrative expertise. Capital Shift: Shifted capital to Murshidabad, symbolizing Bengal's new autonomous identity separate from Mughal centers. Administrative Reform: Introduced Mal Jasmani, a revenue reform focusing on leaseholder security. This demonstrated state-building capacity beyond military power - creating stable revenue system essential for autonomous state. Succession Line: 1) Murshid Quli Khan (post-1717) - founder, 2) Shuja-ud-Din (son-in-law) - family succession, 3) Alivardi Khan (1740) - secured position amid Maratha invasions, demonstrating military and diplomatic skill, 4) Siraj-ud-Daula - final independent Nawab. End of Independence: Battle of Plassey (1757) where East India Company intervened, Siraj-ud-Daula's reign ended. This marked Bengal's transition from Successor State to Company control. Timeline: ~40 years of independence (1717-1757), similar to Awadh (1722-1764). Pattern: Bengal exemplifies Successor State trajectory - Mughal official (Diwan) establishing autonomy, administrative innovation (Mal Jasmani), succession through family/officials, external threats (Marathas), ultimate defeat by British (Plassey). Bengal's wealth and strategic position made it prime target for British expansion."

        "question": "Compare the administrative innovations and challenges faced by Bengal's rulers from Murshid Quli Khan to Siraj-ud-Daula.",
        "answer": "Murshid Quli Khan (post-1717): Innovations: 1) Shifted capital to Murshidabad - establishing new center of power, 2) Introduced Mal Jasmani revenue reform focusing on leaseholder security - innovative approach prioritizing stability over maximum extraction, demonstrating sophisticated state-building. Challenge: Establishing legitimacy as former Diwan declaring independence. Succession: Son-in-law Shuja-ud-Din maintained father-in-law's system, showing continuity. Alivardi Khan (1740): Challenge: Maratha invasions - secured his position amid external military threat. Had to balance military defense with maintaining administration. No major innovations mentioned, suggesting focus on survival. Siraj-ud-Daula: Ultimate Challenge: East India Company intervention at Battle of Plassey (1757). His reign ended Bengal's independence. Evolution: Murshid Quli Khan's period focused on state-building and administrative innovation (Mal Jasmani). Later rulers faced increasing external threats - first Marathas (Alivardi Khan), then British (Siraj-ud-Daula). Pattern: Early autonomy period allowed administrative innovation, but later rulers increasingly focused on military survival. Mal Jasmani's focus on leaseholder security suggests Bengal's rulers understood that stable revenue base depended on productive economy, not just extraction. However, administrative sophistication couldn't overcome British military and diplomatic advantages demonstrated at Plassey."
