Heraka movement, led by Haipou Jadonang, was socio-religious movement advocating for Naga self-(Naga Raj) and resistance against British missionaries and their efforts to convert tribes to Christianity. Rani Gaidinliu, after embracing Gandhian principles, initiated open rebellion against British rule at age 17. Naga tribes refused to pay taxes and cooperate with British. Movement had reformist religious objectives but also strong political undertones challenging British rule. British authorities, fearful of movement's growing influence, arrested and executed Jadonang in 1931. Gaidinliu captured in 1932 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Despite repression, movement had lasting cultural and political impacts on Naga resistance"
