        "question": "What distinguished the Danish approach in India from other European powers?",
        "answer": "The Danish East India Company (established 1616) focused primarily on missionary activities rather than commercial or political ambitions. This distinguished them from the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French who pursued trade monopolies, territorial control, or both. Danish established only two settlements: Tranquebar (1620) near Tanjore as their first factory, and Serampore near Calcutta which became their most significant settlement. The emphasis on missionary work over commerce or conquest made Danish presence in India unique among European powers."

        "question": "Describe the establishment and significance of Danish settlements in India.",
        "answer": "Danish East India Company established in 1616 created two main settlements in India. First factory was at Tranquebar (1620) near Tanjore on the Tamil Nadu coast. Later, Serampore near Calcutta (in Bengal) became their most significant settlement. While Tranquebar was the initial entry point, Serampore grew in importance, likely due to its proximity to the major commercial center of Calcutta and its suitability for their primary focus - missionary activities. These two settlements represented the limited but distinctive Danish presence in India, marked more by religious mission than commercial ambition."
