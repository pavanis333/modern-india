        "question": "Analyze the establishment of Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad in the context of Nadir Shah's invasion and Mughal decline.",
        "answer": "Context - Nadir Shah's Invasion: Nadir Shah invaded India (1738-39), defeated Mughals at Battle of Karnal, looted Delhi including Peacock Throne and Kohinoor. Left Mughal Empire devastated and vulnerable. Rohilkhand Establishment: The Rohillas, led by Daud and his son Ali Mohammad Khan, established Rohilkhand from Bareilly. Timing: Post-Nadir Shah's invasion - directly capitalizing on Mughal weakness created by invasion. Strategy: Opportunistic state formation taking advantage of power vacuum and Mughal inability to control territories. Farrukhabad Establishment: Established by Mohammad Khan Bangash, an Afghan chieftain. Location: Near Delhi - close to Mughal capital, showing extent of Mughal weakness that Afghan chieftain could establish independent state near capital itself. Afghan Connection: Both involved Afghan/Rohilla (Afghan origin) groups - Nadir Shah (Persian) and Ahmad Shah Abdali (Afghan) invasions created environment where Afghan groups could establish territories in India. Pattern: External invasion (Nadir Shah 1738-39) \u2192 Mughal weakness \u2192 Opportunistic state formation (Rohilkhand from Bareilly, Farrukhabad near Delhi) \u2192 New States established. Significance as 'The New States': Neither were Mughal provinces asserting autonomy (Successor States) nor existing kingdoms (Independent Kingdoms). Both were new political entities created by seizing opportunity during Mughal collapse. Represents how 18th century saw emergence of multiple power centers exploiting Mughal decline, creating fragmented political landscape that would eventually facilitate British expansion."

        "question": "Compare Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad establishments with other 'New States' like Marathas and Sikhs in terms of origin, timing, and state-building approach.",
        "answer": "Origins: Marathas: Originally soldiers for Deccan Sultanates, rose from within Indian military systems. Sikhs: Religious community facing persecution, militarized under Gurus (Khalsa 1699). Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: Afghan/Rohilla groups from outside, establishing territories during Mughal weakness. Timing: Marathas: Earlier - Shivaji founded empire before/during Aurangzeb's reign, expanding through 18th century. Sikhs: Guru Tegh Bahadur executed late 17th century, Khalsa 1699, revolts early 18th century. Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: Post-Nadir Shah invasion (after 1738-39) - later opportunistic formation. State-Building Approach: Marathas: Long-term empire building - Shivaji's foundation, Peshwa consolidation (Balaji Vishwanath), territorial expansion (Baji Rao I to Agra). Unique revenue system (Chauth, Sardeshmukhi). Comprehensive state structure. Sikhs: Ideological/religious foundation - Khalsa militancy, social reform (Banda Bahadur ended Zamindari), later consolidation (Ranjit Singh united 12 misls). State built on religious-military identity. Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: Opportunistic seizure - capitalizing on Mughal weakness post-Nadir Shah. Quick establishment (Rohilkhand from Bareilly, Farrukhabad near Delhi). Less detailed about administrative innovations. Legitimacy: Marathas: Built legitimacy through Shivaji's Hindu kingship, protection against Mughals, revenue extraction. Sikhs: Religious identity, Guru lineage, resistance to persecution, Khalsa militancy. Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: Power vacuum exploitation, military control, Afghan/Rohilla group identity. Durability: Marathas: Long trajectory until Third Panipat (1761) - substantial empire. Sikhs: Through Ranjit Singh's empire (Treaty of Amritsar 1809), until 1849. Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: Less information on longevity - likely shorter-lived or absorbed. Pattern: All are 'The New States' (established through rebellion/opposition to Mughals), but Marathas and Sikhs showed more comprehensive state-building, longer duration, and deeper ideological foundations than opportunistic Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad. Marathas/Sikhs: Indigenous resistance movements building states. Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad: External groups exploiting weakness."
