      "back": "Singhbhum & Ranchi, Chotanagpur. Leader: Raja of Parahat (Ho), Birsa Munda. Context: 1765 Chotanagpur came under British control as part of Bengal, Bihar, Orissa. Raja of Singhbhum initially sought protection from British in 1767 but acknowledged British feudal control in 1820. The Hos initially allied with British, eventually broke alliance and united with Mundas, leading to Kol Uprising (1831-33). Rebellion targeted dikkus (non-Adivasi landowners) through violence, including burning of houses and significant casualties. British land policies undermined traditional system, such as Khuntkatti system (joint tenures), and missionary activities undermined their traditional culture. Exploitation of land by moneylenders intensified suffering. Birsa Munda (1890s) became prominent leader, promoting social reforms like abstinence from alcohol and witchcraft, cleanliness, social reforms. Led armed rebellion against British authorities with goal to liberate tribal communities from British oppression and exploitation. Impact: The Ulgulan movement severely shook British rule in region. Chotanagpur Tenancy Act (1908) enacted to protect tribal rights. Legacy: Birsa Munda revered as tribal hero and symbol of resistance against colonial oppression"
