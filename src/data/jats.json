        "question": "Analyze the Jat uprisings as an example of peasant resistance during Aurangzeb's reign and their categorization as 'The New States'.",
        "answer": "Jat Origins: Primarily agricultural settlers - peasant/farming community, not military or administrative elite. This distinguishes Jats from other state-builders (Mughal officials, military leaders, royal dynasties). Rebellion Against Aurangzeb: Rebelled against Aurangzeb's policies. Context: Aurangzeb's reign (1658-1707) saw various policies alienating different groups - religious policies (Jizya reinstatement), economic extraction, aggressive military campaigns. Jat rebellion likely response to economic burdens, administrative oppression, or religious policies affecting agricultural communities. Significant Uprisings: Led to significant uprisings - not isolated incidents but substantial rebellions challenging Mughal authority. Agricultural settlers mounting 'significant uprisings' demonstrates depth of discontent and organizational capacity of peasant communities. As 'The New States': Categorized with Marathas, Sikhs, Rohilkhand/Farrukhabad - groups establishing power through rebellion against Mughal rule. Unique Aspect: While Marathas (soldiers), Sikhs (religious community), and Rohillas (Afghan groups) had military/organizational foundations, Jats were 'primarily agricultural settlers' - peasant uprising creating political entity. Significance: Jat uprisings show Mughal decline wasn't just about elite power struggles (Successor States) or military challenges (Marathas, Sikhs) but also grassroots peasant resistance. Agricultural communities could organize significant rebellions and establish autonomous power. Pattern: Agricultural settlers \u2192 Aurangzeb's oppressive policies \u2192 Rebellion \u2192 Significant uprisings \u2192 New State formation. Represents bottom-up state formation from peasant base, contrasting with top-down (Successor States from officials) or military-based (Marathas, Sikhs) state-building."
