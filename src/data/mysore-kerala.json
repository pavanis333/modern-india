        "answer": "Dynasty Context: Mysore was under the Wodeyars ruling dynasty. Haider Ali and later Tipu Sultan emerged during this period, coming to power and leading resistance. Haider Ali: First major leader to fiercely resist British encroachment in Mysore. Established pattern of military resistance rather than accommodation. His rise demonstrated how military leaders could assume effective control even under nominal royal dynasties. Tipu Sultan: Continued and intensified his father Haider Ali's fierce resistance to British encroachment. 'Later' indicates succession from father, maintaining family and policy continuity. Fierce Resistance: Characterized by military confrontation, refusal to submit, innovative military tactics and alliances. Distinct from Successor States (Awadh, Bengal) that eventually succumbed to British through treaties/defeats. Independent Kingdom: Mysore's categorization as Independent Kingdom (not Successor State) meant no Mughal connection to leverage or lose. Resistance based purely on independent sovereignty and military strength. Pattern: Wodeyar dynasty \u2192 Military leaders (Haider Ali, Tipu Sultan) \u2192 Fierce resistance. Shows how 18th century Indian states adapted, with effective military leaders rising to meet British threat, even when nominal royal dynasties existed. Mysore's resistance made it one of the most significant challenges to British expansion in South India."

        "question": "Compare state-building in Mysore (Haider Ali/Tipu Sultan) and Kerala (Martanda Varma) as Independent Kingdoms.",
        "answer": "Mysore State-Building: Under Wodeyars, but Haider Ali and later Tipu Sultan effectively controlled state. Focus: Military resistance - fiercely resisted British encroachment. State-building centered on military strength, innovation in warfare, building alliances against British. Defensive state-building against external threat. Kerala (Travancore) State-Building: Martanda Varma expanded the region - territorial expansion creating larger state. Established Travancore - formal state creation with defined identity. Reformed the military - not just building army but reforming it, suggesting systematic approach to state power. Proactive state-building through expansion and reform. Similarities: Both Independent Kingdoms (not Mughal provinces). Both emphasized military strength - Mysore for resistance, Kerala for expansion and consolidation. Both had strong leaders driving state formation. Differences: Mysore: Resistance-focused, defending against British. Military leaders under nominal dynasty. Kerala: Expansion-focused, growing territory. Martanda Varma as primary ruler establishing new state (Travancore). Mysore reactive to British threat, Kerala proactive in territorial consolidation. Significance: Independent Kingdoms had different state-building trajectories depending on geography and threats. South Indian states (Mysore, Kerala) had greater autonomy from Mughal decline dynamics, allowing different development paths - resistance (Mysore) or expansion (Kerala). Both showed sophisticated state-building capacity in 18th century outside Mughal framework."
