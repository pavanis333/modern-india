        "question": "Trace the evolution of Sikh resistance from Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom through Guru Gobind Singh's Khalsa (1699) to Banda Bahadur's revolts (1710).",
        "answer": "Guru Tegh Bahadur's Martyrdom: Executed by Aurangzeb for resisting forced conversions and defending Kashmiri Pandits. Significance: Established pattern of Sikh resistance to religious persecution, martyrdom for defending others' religious freedom (Kashmiri Pandits), direct confrontation with Mughal authority (Aurangzeb). Guru Gobind Singh's Response: Transformed Sikhs into militant group, establishing Khalsa in 1699. Khalsa: Militant Sikh organization advocating armed resistance - formalized military structure for resistance. This transformation from spiritual community to armed resistance group was direct response to Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution. Banda Bahadur's Revolts: Led Sikh revolts post-Gobind Singh (after 1699). Not just military resistance but social revolution - ended Zamindari system, challenging feudal structure. Ultimate fate: Captured and executed in 1710 by Mughals. Evolution Pattern: Martyrdom (Tegh Bahadur) \u2192 Militarization (Gobind Singh's Khalsa 1699) \u2192 Armed Revolt (Banda Bahadur) \u2192 Execution (1710). Each phase escalated Sikh-Mughal conflict. Period: ~1675 (Tegh Bahadur's execution) to 1710 (Banda Bahadur's execution) = ~35 years of intensifying resistance. Significance: Sikhs exemplify 'The New States' category - established through active rebellion against Mughal rule, not provincial autonomy or gradual independence. Religious persecution \u2192 militant organization \u2192 armed revolt \u2192 social reform = revolutionary state-building pattern distinct from Successor States."

        "question": "Analyze Ranjit Singh's state-building: unification of 12 misls, military modernization, territorial expansion, and Treaty of Amritsar (1809) with the British.",
        "answer": "Unification of 12 Misls: Misls were Sikh confederacies that emerged after earlier Sikh leaders. Ranjit Singh united 12 misls to found Sikh Empire in Punjab - consolidated fragmented Sikh power into single state. This required diplomatic and military skill to bring independent groups under unified authority. Sikh Empire Foundation: Created formal state structure in Punjab - transformed from militant group/confederacies to established empire. Military Modernization: Modernised the military - not just building army but updating tactics, organization, weaponry to compete with contemporary powers (British, others). Essential for territorial expansion and state survival. Territorial Expansion: Expanded territory beyond Punjab core, building significant regional empire. Combined military modernization with expansion - modern military enabled conquest. Treaty of Amritsar (1809): Signed with British, recognizing their authority over Cis-Sutlej territories (territories on British side of Sutlej River). Significance: Pragmatic recognition of British power, defining boundaries preventing conflict, maintaining Sikh Empire independence north/west of Sutlej while acknowledging British sphere south/east. State-Building Success: Ranjit Singh transformed Sikh resistance movement into established empire - military modernization, territorial control, diplomatic recognition (Treaty of Amritsar), administrative consolidation (uniting misls). Peak of Sikh Power: Represented zenith of Sikh state formation - from persecuted religious community (Guru Tegh Bahadur) \u2192 militant organization (Khalsa 1699) \u2192 armed revolt (Banda Bahadur) \u2192 fragmented confederacies (misls) \u2192 unified empire (Ranjit Singh). However, Treaty of Amritsar (1809) also indicated limits - British controlled Cis-Sutlej, constraining further expansion, setting stage for eventual British-Sikh conflicts after Ranjit Singh's death."

        "id": "comp003",
        "question": "Compare the Sikh trajectory (The New States) with Successor States (Hyderabad, Awadh, Bengal) in terms of origin, state formation, and relationship with British.",
        "answer": "Origin: Successor States: Formed by Mughal officials (Wazir, Diwan, Faujdar) asserting autonomy - worked within Mughal system before independence. Sikhs (The New States): Formed through active rebellion against Mughal persecution - Guru executions, Khalsa militancy, armed revolts. Revolutionary origin outside Mughal framework. State Formation: Successor States: Gradual autonomy of existing provinces - administrative continuity, maintained Mughal structures with autonomous governors. Sikhs: Built from religious community \u2192 militant organization (Khalsa 1699) \u2192 armed revolts (Banda Bahadur) \u2192 confederacies (misls) \u2192 empire (Ranjit Singh). Complete transformation, new political identity based on religion/resistance. Relationship with Mughals: Successor States: Nominal allegiance initially, didn't contest Mughal supremacy openly. Sikhs: Open rebellion, executed Gurus, armed resistance - no pretense of Mughal loyalty. Relationship with British: Successor States: Defeated/absorbed relatively early - Battle of Plassey (Bengal 1757), Battle of Buxar (Awadh 1764). Became Company territories or puppet states. Sikhs: Later engagement - Treaty of Amritsar (1809) with Ranjit Singh recognized British Cis-Sutlej control but maintained Sikh Empire independence. Negotiated boundary rather than immediate subordination. Social Reform: Successor States: Administrative reforms (Bengal's Mal Jasmani, Hyderabad's blended administration). Sikhs: Revolutionary social change - Banda Bahadur ended Zamindari system, Khalsa's egalitarian principles. Durability: Successor States: Relatively brief independence - Awadh 42 years (1722-1764), Bengal 40 years (1717-1757). Sikhs: Longer trajectory - resistance from ~1675 (Tegh Bahadur) through Ranjit Singh's empire (1809 treaty), even surviving his death until 1849. Pattern: Sikhs as 'The New States' showed more revolutionary state-building, longer resistance, later accommodation with British, and more fundamental social transformation than Successor States' administrative autonomy model."
