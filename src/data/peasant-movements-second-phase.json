Cause: Peasant resistance against coerced indigo cultivation for European planters, exploitation through fraudulent contracts, coercion, threats. Nature: Peasants attacked indigo factories with spears and swords, physical and economic resistance including rent strikes. Outcome: British response via Indigo Commission (1860) to address abuses, victory for peasants as indigo cultivation declined by 1860. Cultural Impact: Neel Darpan (1860) by Dinabandhu Mitra, articles in The Hindu Patriot by Harish Chandra Mukherjee raised awareness of peasants' plight. Indigo cultivation in India declined by beginning of 20th century due to unprofitability [UPSC 2020]"

Peasants faced severe hardship, Phadke aimed to alleviate suffering. Nature: Phadke, lacking funds, turned to raiding government treasuries to create army and support villagers. First raid occurred in Dhamari (Pune district) targeting income tax stored in home. Treasury raids occurred in Shirur and Khed talukas to support starving communities. Phadke strategically disabled British communication lines during raids. Outcome: Uprising weakened when British forces ambushed and fatally shot Naik, a leader of movement"

Outcome: Government responded by inviting Gandhi for talks and appointing him to committee. Committee's findings led to abolition of Treen Kathia system"

Cause: Oppression by upper-caste Hindu landlords and British land laws in 19th century, stripping Mappilas of customary land rights. Peasants subjected to high rents, oppressive fees, and insecure tenures. Khilafat movement and Congress support for tenants' grievances laid groundwork for revolt.
