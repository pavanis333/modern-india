From periphery to center of nationalist movement. Risk Escalation: Legal battles \u2192 Public protests \u2192 Arrests \u2192 Leading raids \u2192 Armed violence \u2192 Martyrdom.

All regions participating. Continuity: Margaret Cousins (1916 WIA, 1917 Association, 1927 AIWC). Sarojini Naidu (1919 Rowlatt, 1927 AIWC, 1930 Salt). Kasturba Gandhi (1919 Rowlatt, 1942 Quit India). Bina Das (1942 assassination attempt, 1943 famine relief). Long-term commitment across multiple movements. Significance: Women weren't auxiliary to national movement - they were integral across all phases: social reform, mass mobilization, armed struggle, underground resistance, humanitarian work, post-independence rehabilitation. Their participation challenged both colonial rule and patriarchal norms simultaneously, achieving dual emancipation (national and gendered). By 1947, women had proven capacity for every form of political action: legal activism, mass protest, organizational leadership, revolutionary violence, clandestine resistance, humanitarian service, and post-conflict reconstruction."
