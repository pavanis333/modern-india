Ahmad Shah Abdali's Invasions: Captured Delhi in 1757 and appointed an Afghan caretaker for the Mughal emperor. Defeated the Marathas at the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), marking a significant setback for the Mughal Empire. Impact: These invasions exposed Mughal military weakness, depleted imperial treasury (Nadir Shah's loot), undermined central authority (Afghan caretaker appointed), and eliminated potential Mughal allies (Maratha defeat at Panipat). The invasions accelerated Mughal decline, making regional autonomy irreversible and creating power vacuum that British would exploit."

Religious tolerance - abolished Jizya and pilgrimage tax. Granted British EIC trading privileges (contributed to their rise). First emperor killed by nobles (Sayyid Brothers with Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath). Rafi-ud-Darajat (1719): Shortest reign among Mughals. Rafi-ud-Daula (1719): Installed by Sayyid Brothers as 'Shah Jahan II'.

Supported cultural advancement, promoted Urdu as court language. Pattern: Short, violent reigns; dependence on kingmakers (Sayyid Brothers, nobles); granting concessions to British; military defeats; emergence of independent states (Hyderabad).

Declared 'Emperor of India' during 1857 Revolt - last symbolic assertion of Mughal authority. Captured after revolt, exiled to Rangoon, died 1862. Mughal Empire legally ended November 1, 1858 with Queen Victoria's declaration. Relationship Evolution: Treaty of Allahabad (1765) made emperor financially dependent. 1835 withdrawal of recognition ended political legitimacy. 1857 Revolt briefly restored symbolic status. 1858 declaration formally abolished empire. From sovereign to pensioner to non-entity - complete subordination to British over 100 years."

        "question": "Assess the internal factors contributing to Mughal decline from Aurangzeb to Muhammad Shah, including succession struggles and regional autonomy movements.",
        "answer": "Internal Factors of Decline: Aurangzeb's Legacy (1658-1707): His policies initiated downward spiral. Exacerbated by succession struggles and incompetent successors. Succession Struggles: Violent transitions - Farrukhsiyar killed Jahandar Shah (1713), later killed by Sayyid Brothers (1719). Noble interference - Sayyid Brothers installed/removed emperors (Farrukhsiyar, Rafi-ud-Darajat, Rafi-ud-Daula). Shortest reigns - Rafi-ud-Darajat (1719), frequent instability. Regional Autonomy: By Muhammad Shah's time (1719-48), regional states like Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh, and Punjab emerged as local leaders sought autonomy. Nizam-ul-Mulk established independent Hyderabad after helping Muhammad Shah. Incompetent Rule: Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1748-54) left affairs to 'Queen Mother' Udham Bai. Emperors became puppets of nobles, wives, or external powers. Financial Weakness: Izara system (Jahandar Shah) attempted to strengthen finances - indicates existing fiscal crisis. Nadir Shah's loot (1739) devastated treasury. Granting Concessions: Farrukhsiyar granted British EIC trading privileges - contributed to British rise. Treaty of Allahabad (1765) gave revenue rights - surrendered core sovereignty function. Pattern: Internal power struggles, noble dominance, regional fragmentation, financial collapse, foreign concessions - compounding factors making Mughal revival impossible by mid-18th century."
